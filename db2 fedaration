Database federation in DB2 LUW (Linux, Unix, Windows) allows you to access and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous data sources as if they were part of a single database. Federation is commonly used in scenarios where you want to query or manage data from multiple databases or external systems without having to move the data into a single database.

Here is an overview of **DB2 Table and Database Federation in DB2 LUW**:
---
### 1. **Setting Up Federation in DB2 LUW**
To enable database federation, you need to:
- Enable the federation feature.
- Configure wrappers to interact with the external data source.
- Create server definitions to connect to the data source.
- Define nicknames for remote tables so they can be queried as if they exist locally.

#### Steps:
1. **Enable Federation**
   - Ensure that federation is enabled for your DB2 instance:
     ```bash
     db2set DB2_FEDERATED=YES
     db2stop
     db2start
     ``
2. **Install Wrappers**
   - DB2 comes with built-in wrappers for certain data sources (e.g., `DRDA`, `Oracle`, `ODBC`). Use the following command to register a wrapper:
     ```sql
     CREATE WRAPPER drda;
     ```
3. **Create Server Definitions**
   - Define a server for the data source you want to federate:
     ```sql
     CREATE SERVER remote_server
     TYPE DB2/UDB
     VERSION '11.5'
     WRAPPER drda
     AUTHORIZATION 'username'
     PASSWORD 'password'
     OPTIONS (HOST 'remote_host', PORT '50000', DBNAME 'remote_db');
     ```
4. **Create Nicknames**
   - Create nicknames to represent tables from the remote database:
     ```sql
     CREATE NICKNAME local_table FOR remote_server.schema.remote_table;
     ```
5. **Query Remote Tables**
   - Once nicknames are created, you can query the remote tables as if they were local tables:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM local_table;   ```

### 2. **Federated Database Objects**
Federation involves several key objects:
- **Wrapper**: A connector that defines how DB2 interacts with a specific type of data source.
- **Server**: Represents a remote database or data source.
- **User Mapping**: Maps a local DB2 user to a remote data source user.
- **Nickname**: A local alias for a remote table or view.
---
### 3. **Supported Data Sources**
DB2 LUW supports federation with the following data sources:
- Other DB2 databases (via DRDA wrapper).
- Non-DB2 relational databases like Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL (via ODBC or specific wrappers).
- Non-relational data sources like flat files and web services (with custom configurations).
---
### 4. **Examples**
#### Example: Federating a Table from a Remote DB2 Database
1. **Create Wrapper**:
   ```sql
   CREATE WRAPPER drda;
   ```
2. **Create Server**:
   ```sql
   CREATE SERVER remote_db_server
   TYPE DB2/UDB
   VERSION '11.5'
   WRAPPER drda
   OPTIONS (HOST '192.168.1.100', PORT '50000', DBNAME 'HRDB');
   ```
3. **Create User Mapping**:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER MAPPING FOR CURRENT_USER
   SERVER remote_db_server
   OPTIONS (REMOTE_AUTHID 'remote_user', REMOTE_PASSWORD 'remote_pass');
   ```
4. **Create Nickname**:
   ```sql
   CREATE NICKNAME remote_employee FOR remote_db_server.hr.employee;
   ```
5. **Query the Remote Table**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM remote_employee;
   ```
### 5. **Considerations**
- **Performance**: Query performance may depend on the network latency and the capability of the remote system.
- **Security**: Ensure secure connections to remote servers, and use appropriate user mapping for access control.
- **Data Types**: Ensure compatible data types between DB2 and the remote database.
- **Transaction Management**: Distributed transactions may require additional configuration.
